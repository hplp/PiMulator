	help
	  perf (sometimes "Perf Events" or perf tools, originally
	  "Performance Counters for Linux") - is a performance
	  analyzing tool in Linux, available from kernel version
	  2.6.31. User-space controlling utility, called 'perf' has
	  git-like interface with subcommands. It is capable of
	  statistical profiling of entire system (both kernel and user
	  code), single CPU or severals threads.

	  This will build and install the userspace 'perf'
	  command. It is up to the user to ensure that the kernel
	  configuration has all the suitable options enabled to allow a
	  proper operation of 'perf'.

	help
	  Build and install (to /usr/lib/kselftests) kernel selftests.

	  Use of this option implies you know the process of using and
	  compiling the kernel selftests. The Makefile to build and
	  install these is very noisy and may appear to cause your
	  build to fail for strange reasons.

	  This is very much a use at your risk option and may not work
	  for every setup or every architecture.
