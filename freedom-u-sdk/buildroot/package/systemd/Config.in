	  systemd is a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with
	  SysV and LSB init scripts. systemd provides aggressive parallelization
	  capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services,
	  offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
	  Linux cgroups, supports snapshotting and restoring of the system
	  state, maintains mount and automount points and implements an
	  elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
	  It can work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit.

	  Systemd requires a Linux kernel >= 3.0 with the following options
	  enabled:

	  - CONFIG_CGROUPS
	  - CONFIG_INOTIFY_USER
	  - CONFIG_FHANDLE
	  - CONFIG_AUTOFS4_FS
	  - CONFIG_TMPFS_POSIX_ACL
	  - CONFIG_TMPFS_XATTR

	  These options will be automatically enabled by Buildroot if
	  it is responsible for building the kernel. Otherwise, if you
	  are building your kernel outside of Buildroot, make sure
	  these options are enabled.

	  Systemd also provides udev, the userspace device daemon.

	  The selection of other packages will enable some features:

	  - acl package will add support for multi-seat.
	  - xz and/or l4 packages will add compression support in
	    journal and coredump.
	  - libcurl package will add support for systemd-journal-upload.
	  - libgcrypt package will add support for journal sealing and
	    DNSSEC verification in resolved.

	  systemd-networkd is a system service that manages networks.
	  It detects and configures network devices as they appear, as well as
	  creating virtual network devices.

	  This simple network configuration solution is an alternative to

	  This feature requires a kernel >= 3.8.

	  When this feature is enabled, Systemd mounts smackfs and manages
	  security labels for sockets.
