	  OProfile is a system-wide profiler for Linux systems,
	  capable of profiling all running code at low overhead.
	  OProfile is released under the GNU GPL.

	  It consists of a kernel driver and a daemon for collecting
	  sample data, and several post-profiling tools for turning
	  data into information.

	  OProfile leverages the hardware performance counters of the
	  CPU to enable profiling of a wide variety of interesting
	  statistics, which can also be used for basic time-spent
	  profiling. All code is profiled: hardware and software
	  interrupt handlers, kernel modules, the kernel, shared
	  libraries, and applications.
