	  Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework for
	  developers using C++.

	  This package corresponds to the qt5webkit module.

	  This package has been removed from the official release packages
	  since Qt5.6.0, but it is still available for users to build it
	  from source. This is useful for platforms without GPU since the
	  successor (QtWebEngine) requires OpenGL support.
