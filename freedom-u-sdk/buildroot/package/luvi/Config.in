	  A project in-between luv and luvit. The goal of this is to make
	  building luvit and derivatives much easier.

	  luvi extends LuaJIT with asynchronous I/O and several optional
	  modules to run Lua applications and build self-contained binaries
	  on systems that don't have a compiler.

	  The luvi core can be extended with several Lua modules by adding its
	  bundled Lua binding libraries. To get the Lua module...
	    * 'rex' select PCRE (BR2_PACKAGE_PCRE)
	    * 'ssl' select OpenSSL (BR2_PACKAGE_OPENSSL)
	    * 'zlib' select zlib (BR2_PACKAGE_ZLIB)
