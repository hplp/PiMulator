	  Inspired by jMock, EasyMock, and Hamcrest, and designed with C++'s
	  specifics in mind, Google C++ Mocking Framework (or Google Mock for
	  short) is a library for writing and using C++ mock classes.

	  Google Mock:

	    * lets you create mock classes trivially using simple macros,
	    * supports a rich set of matchers and actions,
	    * handles unordered, partially ordered, or completely ordered
	      expectations,
	    * is extensible by users, and
	    * works on Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Windows Mobile, minGW, and
	      Symbian.

	  There are both host and target packages. The target one has include
	  files required to compile the tests and the static libraries required
	  to link/run them. The host package installs gmock_gen, a Python script
	  used to generate code mocks.
