	  Google-Breakpad is a library and tool suite that allows you
	  to distribute an application to users with compiler-provided
	  debugging information removed, record crashes in compact
	  "minidump" files, send them back to your server, and produce
	  C and C++ stack traces from these minidumps. Breakpad can
	  also write minidumps on request for programs that have not
	  crashed.

	  You may want to set BR2_ENABLE_DEBUG, in order to get useful
	  results.

	  This target package installs a static library named
	  libbreakpad_client.a which should be linked into programs
	  willing to use Google Breakpad. A host variant of this
	  package is also available, and provides the different tools
	  needed to extract the debugging symbols from target
	  binaries.
