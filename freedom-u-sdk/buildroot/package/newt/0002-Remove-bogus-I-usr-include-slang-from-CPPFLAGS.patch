Subject: [PATCH newt 2/2] Remove bogus -I/usr/include/slang from CPPFLAGS

Hardcoding -I/usr/include/slang in CPPFLAGS is bogus for
cross-compilation. With recent versions of slang, the headers are
installed in ${sysroot}/usr/include directly, so there is no need for
an additional flag. And if one was needed, it should be added by the
configure script, after detecting the right header location.
