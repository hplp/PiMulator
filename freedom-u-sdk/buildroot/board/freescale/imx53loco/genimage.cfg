# Minimal microSD card image for the Freescale's i.MX53 QSB board
#
# We mimic the .sdcard Freescale's image format for i.MX53:
# * the microSD card must have 1 kB free space at the beginning,
# * U-Boot is dumped as is,
# * a FAT partition at offset 8 MB is containing zImage and dtbs,
# * a single root filesystem partition is required (Ext4 in this case).
