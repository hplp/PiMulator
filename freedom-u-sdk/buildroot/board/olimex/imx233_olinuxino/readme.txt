This configuration is intended as a base image.
It includes kernel and firmware support for the common USB WiFi hardware.
Packages for WiFi support are up to the user, you'll probably want
one or more of: hostapd, iw, wireless_tools and/or wpa_supplicant.

It also pulls up the console on the serial port, not on TV output.

=== Output files after building ==============================================

output/images
+-- kernel.vfat (VFAT kernel partition image generated by genimage)
+-- rootfs.ext2 (Root file system)
+-- sdcard.img (Complete SD card image generated by genimage)
+-- u-boot.sd (U-Boot image)
+-- uImage -> uImage.imx23-olinuxino (To copy kernel as "uImage" to kernel.vfat)
+-- uImage.imx23-olinuxino (Kernel uImage)

=== Use of generated SD card image ===========================================

Just write sdcard.img directly to the SD card

***** WARNING: Double check that /dev/sdc is your MicroSD card *****
*****      It might be /dev/sdb or some other device name      *****
***** Failure to do so may result in you wiping your hard disk *****

   # dd if=output/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/sdc bs=512

=== Manual creation of SD card image =========================================

You'll need a spare MicroSD card with Freescale's special partition layout.
This is basically three partitions:

1) Type 53, the U-Boot partition, should be 16MB.
2) VFAT, place the kernel uImage there
3) Anything you like, for this example an ext2 partition, type 83 (linux).

Assuming you see your MicroSD card as /dev/sdc you'd need to do, as root
and from the buildroot project top level directory:
(remember to replace /dev/sdc* with the appropiate device name!)

***** WARNING: Double check that /dev/sdc is your MicroSD card *****
*****      It might be /dev/sdb or some other device name      *****

1. Unmount the filesystem(s) if they're already mounted, usually...

   # for fs in `grep /dev/sdc /proc/mounts|cut -d ' ' -f 1`;do umount $fs;done

   ...should work

2. Blank the partition table out

   # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc bs=1024 count=1024

3. Set up the partitions

   # fdisk /dev/sdc
   n
   p
   1
   <ENTER>
   +16MB
   t
   53
   n
   p

   +5M
   t
   2
   4
   n
   p

   <ENTER>
   <ENTER>
   w

4. Fill up the first (U-Boot) partition
   # dd if=output/images/u-boot.sd bs=512 of=/dev/sdc1

5. Create VFAT Filesystem
   # mkfs.vfat /dev/sdc2

6. Mount and copy output/images/uImage.imx23-olinuxino to the VFAT partition, rename to uImage
   # mount /dev/sdc2 /mnt
   # cp output/images/uImages/uImage.imx23-olinuxino /mnt/uImage
   # umount /mnt

7. Fill up the third (filesystem) partition
   # dd if=output/images/rootfs.ext2 of=/dev/sdc3 bs=512

8. Remove the MicroSD card from your linux PC and put it into your olinuxino.

9. Boot! You're done!
