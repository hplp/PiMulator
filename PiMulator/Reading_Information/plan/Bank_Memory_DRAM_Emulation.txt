Plan: 

Memory represented inside CPU (in software) as 3D array

Access Row: 
Bank-CPU Interface: Bank issues row address to CPU
CPU returns data at that row (contrinuous transfer of NUM_COLS bytes via stream AXI)

Write Row: 
Bank-CPU Interface: Bank issues row address to CPU and continuosly issues NUM_COLS bytes via stream AXI
CPU receives all NUM_COLS bytes and writes them in 3D array to row address (via interrupt?)

Realization: 

Modify ACTIVATE / WRITE commands in Bank Hardware Module
