The trace format consists of 6 columns with comma separated values (CSV)

1) Trace event source
   0: AXI Slot 0 - emulates ARM or host accesses
   1: AXI Slot 1 - emulates DRE or on-chip accesses
   S: Software
2) Event type
   R: Memory Read Address
   W: Memory Write Address
   FR: First word of data in read burst
   LR: Last word of data in read burst
   FW: First word of data in write burst
   LW: Last word of data in write burst
   B: Response from write
3) Address in HEX with 0x prefix
4) Length in bytes
5) AXI bus ID
6) Time stamp count
   Each tick represents 5 ns
   When scaled by a factor of 20, each tick represents 0.25 ns

Note that the Address field is in HEX. The other numbers are in decimal.

DRE memory accesses have a "1" in the first column and ARM accesses
have a "0". Host or ARM accesses occur through an AXI interconnect
monitored by Slot 0. On-chip or near memory accesses occur through
a separate AXI interconnect monitored by Slot 1.

AWK can be used to separate the events into different files or remove
columns depending on the input requirement of downstream analysis tools.
